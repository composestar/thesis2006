\section{Framework Class Library}
\label{sec:fcl}
The \dotNET Framework class library is a comprehensive collection of object-oriented reusable types for the CLR. 
This library is the foundation on which all the \dotNET applications are built.
It is object oriented and provides integration of third-party components with the classes in the \dotNET Framework.
Developers can use components provided by the \dotNET Framework, other developers and their own components.

A wide range of common programming tasks (\eg string management, data collection, reflection, graphics, database connectivity or file access) can be accomplished easily by using the class library.
Also a great number of specialized development tasks are extensively supported, like:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Console applications;
  \item Windows GUI applications (Windows Forms);
  \item Web applications (Web Forms);
  \item XML Web services;
  \item Windows services.
\end{itemize}
All the types in this framework are CLS compliant and can therefore be used from any programming language whose compiler conforms to the Common Language Specification (CLS).
