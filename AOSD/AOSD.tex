The first two chapters have originally been written by seven \MSc students~\cite{Holljen2004, Durr2004, Vinkes2004, Bosman2004, Staijen2005, Havinga2005, Boschman2006} at the University of Twente.
The chapters have been rewritten for use in the following theses~\cite{VanOudheusden2006, Conradi2006, TeWinkel2006, Huttenhuis2006, Doornenbal2006, Huisman2006, SpenkelinkD2006}.
They serve as a general introduction into Aspect-Oriented Software Development and \Compose* in particular.
